# Movie Recommendation Project

This repository contains the code and resources for my Movie Recommendation project, which is based on the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset. The project utilizes advanced techniques such as vectorization and stemming from the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to create a powerful recommendation system.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their preferences. By analyzing various attributes of movies, including genres, keywords, and cast and crew members, the recommendation system can suggest movies that are likely to be of interest to individual users.

The project consists of the following components:

1. **Data preprocessing**: The TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset is preprocessed to extract relevant features and perform necessary transformations.
2. **Vectorization**: Textual data, such as movie genres and keywords, are transformed into numerical representations using vectorization techniques.
3. **Stemming**: The NLTK library is used to apply stemming, which reduces words to their root form, improving text analysis and matching.
4. **Recommendation engine**: The recommendation system is built using machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and generate personalized movie recommendations.
5. **User interface**: The project includes a user-friendly interface created with Streamlit, enabling users to input their preferences and receive movie recommendations.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-project.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Download the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset from [TMDB website](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) and place it in the `data` directory.
4. Run the project: `streamlit run app.py`

## Results and Future Improvements

The movie recommendation system has shown promising results in providing personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences. However, there is always room for improvement. Some possible future enhancements for this project include:

- Incorporating user feedback to refine the recommendation engine.
- Implementing additional machine learning algorithms to compare and improve the accuracy of the recommendations.
- Expanding the dataset to include more recent movies and diverse genres.
- Enhancing the user interface with additional features, such as the ability to filter recommendations by release date or popularity.
